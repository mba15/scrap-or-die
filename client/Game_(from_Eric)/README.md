### Warrior Code

Full-Stack Group Project
------------------------
For this project you will be working in a small group of 2-3 students to design a full-stack app.

Project Requirements:

You'll essentially be creating another full-stack application with the same requirements as the previous one, but this time you will build user-authentication into the project.

*You must submit a roposal explaining your app.
*Use JWTs to create a token-based authentication system to authenticate users.
*Include password hashing so that no nonencoded password strings are saved in the database.
*Save the JWT in web storage and set it up to send automatically with every request.
*Include the ability for users to have differing levels of permissions (optional).
*Utilize 'Passport'.
*Also, since you'll be working with other people on this project, you'll need to get used to following best practices with Git so that you aren't overwriting each other's code all the time. Doing this is trickier than it may sound when it's your first time using Git in a team setting. Whenever in doubt, ask an instructor or TA for help using Git so as to minimize your downtime.

Proposal Requirements:

This part of the project is to help you narrow down your idea, clarify its parts, and make it easier to start coding.

*Paragraph describing your app idea: What are you building? Who is it for?
*An easily describable MVP. Remeber that you only have a limited amount of time to develop this project. What is the minimum you can get done on this project to meet the requirements and get a product into someone's hands?
*User Story: What is a user going to do when they go to your site from the moment they hit the landing page? What features do they need and which are optional?
W*ireframe: What is each page going to look like? What will be its layout, color scheme, etc?
*Mind Map: What is the structure of your back-end and front-end going to look like? What routes, models, components, actions, and reducers will you need?

Once you have the fulfill the requirements above you need to meet with your instructor and pass off your proposal before you begin coding.

Passing Criteria: Project Demo to the Class

Your groupo will be presenting your project to the rest of the class and talking about any difficulties or particularly challenging problems you faced and how you solved them.
